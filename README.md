# include_sweeper

Implement very simple 2D Linux game without using any `#includes` and compiling with `-nostdlib` `-nodefaultlibs` `-nostartfiles`.
This is pretty silly but it's fun.

Work in progres...
- [x] Implement basic system call mechanism and main function that can take arguments.
- [x] Implement basic memory allocation primitives.
- [x] Connect and handshake with X11
- [ ] Create a window.
- [ ] Handle mouse and keyboard events.
- [ ] Implement basic math functions (roots, logarithms, trigonometric stuff etc...).
- [ ] Implement basic 2D rendering primitives.
- [ ] Use SDFs to efficiently encode fonts and render them.
- [ ] Implement game logic and rendering.
